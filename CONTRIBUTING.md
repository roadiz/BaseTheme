# Contributing to BaseTheme

BaseTheme is built upon `Twig`, `VueJS`, `ES6 (typescript)` and `SCSS`. If you want to take part in improving our *Roadiz* theme boilerplate, we encourage you to know 
a minimum about these frontend technologies.

We keep this theme starter as fresh as possible and some technology choices 
may changes among time. 

### Use EditorConfig

We added an `.editorconfig` file to make developers use the same codestyle. Please
install the plugin if you’re working with *Atom*, *Sublime Text*, … editors.
